Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class
#id
*
element
element, element
element element
element > element
element + element
:hover
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)

-when we wrap something in a div we do that so that we can section some elements off and decide what style we want to apply on those elements that are within the div


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity: more specific something is the higher its chances are of being applied
-Importance
-Source Order
